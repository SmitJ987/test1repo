#overview of GIT/github
'''
to understand overview of git/github
we first need to understand version control
version control allows us to keep track of changes to our document
so it makes easy to recover older versions of our document if we make mistakes
and it makes collaboration with others much easier
see part of first video of week 2 from 00:58 min. to see picture form of
with and without version control

Git:
free and open source software
distributed version control system
accessible anywhere in the world

it is one of the most common version control systems available
it can also version control images,documents etc.

we can use Git from our command prompt

but Github is one of the most popular web hosting services for the Git repository
others include:
GitLab
BitBucket
BeanStalk

Few basic git Commands that we will always use:
    "git init": when starting out with a new repository, we only need to create it once 
                either locally and then push to github
                or by cloning an existing repository 
                by using the command "git init"
                
    "git add": git add moves changes from the working directory to the staging area
    
    "git status": allows us to see the state of our working directory and the staged snapshot
                    of our changes
    
    "git commit": takes our staged snapshot of changes and commits them to the project
    
    "git reset": undoes changes  that we made to the files in our working directory
    
    "git log": enables us to browse previous changes to a project
    
    "git branch": it let's us create isolated environment within our repository to make changes
    
    "git checkout": it let's us to see and change existing branches
    
    "git merge": let's us put everything back together again
